NAME
----
spiderify - wrapper for spidersocks and spider

SYNOPSIS
--------
**spiderify** __application__ [__application's__ __arguments__]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
**spiderify** is a simple wrapper that attempts to find the best underlying Spider
wrapper available on a system. It calls spidersocks with a spider specific
configuration file. +

spidersocks is an improved wrapper that explicitly rejects UDP, safely resolves DNS
lookups and properly socksifies your TCP connections. +

Please note that since both method use LD_PRELOAD, spiderify cannot be applied to
suid binaries.

WARNING
-------
When used with spidersocks, spiderify should not leak DNS requests or UDP data. +

Both will leak ICMP data.

SEE ALSO
--------
**spider**(1), **spider-resolve**(1), **spidersocks**(1)
