Contents of the Spider state file
==============================

The state file is structured with more or less the same rules as spiderrc.
Recognized fields are:

  SpiderVersion

     The version of Spider that wrote this file

  LastWritten

     Time when this state file was written.
     Given in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

  AccountingBytesReadInInterval     (memory unit)
  AccountingBytesWrittenInInterval  (memory unit)
  AccountingExpectedUsage           (memory unit)
  AccountingIntervalStart           (ISO time)
  AccountingSecondsActive           (time interval)
  AccountingSecondsToReachSoftLimit (time interval)
  AccountingSoftLimitHitAt          (ISO time)
  AccountingBytesAtSoftLimit        (memory unit)

     These fields describe the state of the accounting subsystem.

     The IntervalStart is the time at which the current accounting
     interval began.  We were expecting to use ExpectedUsage over the
     course of the interval.  BytesRead/BytesWritten are the total
     number of bytes transferred over the whole interval.  If Spider has
     been active during the interval, then AccountingSecondsActive is
     the amount of time for which it has been active.  We were expecting
     to hit the bandwidth soft limit in SecondsToReachSoftLimit after we
     became active.  When we hit the soft limit, we record
     BytesAtSoftLimit.  If we hit the soft limit already, we did so at
     SoftLimitHitAt.

  EntryGuard
  EntryGuardDownSince
  EntryGuardUnlistedSince
  EntryGuardAddedBy

      These lines form sections related to entry guards.  Each section
      starts with a single EntryGuard line, and is then followed by
      information on the state of the Entry guard.

      The EntryGuard line contains a nickname, then an identity digest, of
      the guard.

      The EntryGuardDownSince and EntryGuardUnlistedSince lines are present
      if the entry guard is believed to be non-running or non-listed.  If
      present, they contain a line in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

      The EntryGuardAddedBy line is optional.  It contains three
      space-separated fields: the identity of the entry guard, the version of
      Spider that added it, and the ISO time at which it was added.

  TransportProxy

     One or more of these may be present.

     The format is "transportname addr:port", to remember the address
     at which a pluggable transport was listening. Spider bridges use
     this information to spawn pluggable transport listeners in the
     same IP address and TCP port even after spider client restarts.

  BWHisspideryReadEnds           (ISO time)
  BWHisspideryReadInterval       (integer, number of seconds)
  BWHisspideryReadValues         (comma-separated list of integer)
  BWHisspideryReadMaxima         (comma-separated list of integer)
  BWHisspideryWriteEnds
  BWHisspideryWriteInterval
  BWHisspideryWriteValues
  BWHisspideryWriteMaxima
  BWHisspideryDirReadEnds
  BWHisspideryDirReadInterval
  BWHisspideryDirReadValues
  BWHisspideryDirReadMaxima
  BWHisspideryDirWriteEnds
  BWHisspideryDirWriteInterval
  BWHisspideryDirWriteValues
  BWHisspideryDirWriteMaxima

     These values record bandwidth hisspidery.  The "Values" fields are a list, for
     some number of "Intervals", of the total amount read/written during that
     integer.  The "Maxima" are the highest burst for each interval.

     Interval duration is set by the "Interval" field, in seconds.  The
     "Ends" field is the ending time of the last interval in each list.

     The *Read* and *Write* fields are the total amount read and
     written; the *DirRead* and *DirWrite* variants are for directory
     traffic only.

  LastRotatedOnionKey

     The last time that we changed our onion key for a new one.
     Given in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

  TotalBuildTimes
  CircuitBuildAbandonedCount
  CircuitBuildTimeBin

      XXXX writeme.
