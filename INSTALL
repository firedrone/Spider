Most users who realize that INSTALL files still exist should simply
follow the directions at
https://www.spiderproject.org/docs/spider-doc-unix

If you got the source from git, run "./autogen.sh", which will
run the various auto* programs. Then you can run ./configure, and
refer to the above instructions.

If it doesn't build for you:

  If you have problems finding libraries, try
    CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" \
    ./configure
  or
    ./configure --with-libevent-dir=/usr/local
  rather than simply ./configure.

  If you have mysterious autoconf failures while linking openssl,
  consider setting your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the openssl lib directory.
  For example, "setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/athena/lib".

How to do static builds of spider:

Spider supports linking each of the libraries it needs statically. Use the
--enable-static-X ./configure option in conjunction with the --with-X-dir
option for libevent, zlib, and openssl. For this to work sanely, libevent
should be built with --disable-shared --enable-static --with-pic, and
OpenSSL should be built with no-shared no-dso.

If you need to build spider so that system libraries are also statically linked,
use the --enable-static-spider ./configure option. This won't work on OS X
unless you build the required crt0.o yourself. It is also incompatible with
the --enable-gcc-hardening option.

An example of how to build a mostly static spider:
./configure --enable-static-libevent \
            --enable-static-openssl  \
            --enable-static-zlib     \
            --with-libevent-dir=/tmp/static-spider/libevent-1.4.14b-stable \
            --with-openssl-dir=/tmp/static-spider/openssl-0.9.8r/ \
            --with-zlib-dir=/tmp/static-spider/zlib-1.2.5

An example of how to build an entirely static spider:
./configure --enable-static-spider \
            --with-libevent-dir=/tmp/static-spider/libevent-1.4.14b-stable \
            --with-openssl-dir=/tmp/static-spider/openssl-0.9.8r/ \
            --with-zlib-dir=/tmp/static-spider/zlib-1.2.5
