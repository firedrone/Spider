This directory has configuration files that ship with Spider.  They include:

geoip
geoip6

    Geoip files for IPv4 and IPv6

spiderrc.minimal, spiderrc.sample:

    generated from spiderrc.minimal.in and spiderrc.sample.in by autoconf.

spiderrc.minimal.in:

    A very small spiderrc, suitable for installation by default in
    /etc/spider/spiderrc.

    We try to change spiderrc.minimal.in as infrequently as possible,
    since doing so makes the users of many packages have to re-build
    their spiderrc files.


spiderrc.minimal.in-staging

    This is where we stage changes to spiderrc.minimal.in over time so
    that when we have a change large enough to warrant a new
    spiderrc.minimal.in, we can copy all the other changes over
    wholesale.

spiderrc.sample.in:

    A verbose, discursive, batteries-included spiderrc.  Suitable for
    letting people know how to set up various options, including those
    most people shouldn't mess with.
