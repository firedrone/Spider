  o Minor features (infrastructure, seccomp2 sandbox):
    - We now have a document sspiderage backend compatible with the Linux
      seccomp2 sandbox. The long-term plan is to use this backend for
      consensus documents and for sspidering unparseable direcspidery
      material.  Closes ticket 21645.
